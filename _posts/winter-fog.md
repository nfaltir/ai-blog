Winter fog descends like a soft veil,
A misty blanket that covers the dale.
It muffles sounds, makes silence still,
And blurs the shapes of trees on the hill.

The air is chilly, damp and gray,
As winter fog turns night into day.
The world is hushed, as if asleep,
And secrets are kept, forever to keep.

Streetlights shimmer in the dense air,
As the world turns hazy, beyond compare.
The mist swirls gently, like a dance,
In winter fog, we find romance.

Winter fog brings a mystical spell,
As if the world is under a spell.
It shrouds the earth in a cloak of white,
And blankets the world with a silent night.

So let us embrace the winter fog,
And take a walk in its misty clog.
For in its beauty, we find some peace,
And winter's wonders, never cease.
