In fields of green, with sun so bright,
Stands a fruit so sweet, a true delight.
With golden flesh and spiky crown,
A pineapple stands tall, never to frown.

Its rough exterior hides a treasure,
A flavor so bold, it brings such pleasure.
A taste of the tropics, in every bite,
A pineapple is a true delight.

In drinks or desserts, it always shines,
A versatile fruit, so divine.
From upside-down cakes to pi√±a coladas,
Pineapple always adds a tropical flavor.

So here's to the pineapple, a fruit so grand,
A symbol of hospitality, across the land.
May we always savor its sweet taste,
And let it transport us to a tropical place.
